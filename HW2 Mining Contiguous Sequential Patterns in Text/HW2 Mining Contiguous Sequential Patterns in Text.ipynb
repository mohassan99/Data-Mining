    "The provided input file (\"reviews_sample.txt\") consists of 10,000 online reviews from Yelp users.  The reviews have been stemmed to remove the postfix of each word so words with similar semantics can have the same form and most of the punctuation has been removed.  So, each line is a list of strings separated by spaces.    \n",

    "and the minimum support is 2, then patterns like \"A,B,A\" or \"A,C\" are both frequent contiguous sequential patterns, while the pattern \"A,A\" is not a frequent contiguous sequential pattern because in the first two sequences the two A's are not consecutive to each other.  Notice that it is still a frequent sequential pattern though.  \n",

For example, the pattern \"A,B\" appears 1 time in the first sequence and 2 times in the second, but its support should be calculated as 2, as there are only 2 records containing subsequence \"A,B\".  \n",
